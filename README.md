# Assignment-5
What changes you made to the script(s):

I changed the jump speed to be slower so that it takes more time to jump over spikes. Then, I changed the speed of movement so that it can make the game harder. By doing that, I think the game will be harder as you will have to time the jump.

Challenges you faced:

I faced the challenge of making sure the code works and that my win statement also works. I wanted the player to win if they touch the red flag, but I had troubles because I didn't know how to do it. I also had problems with making my spikes as I had never needed to kill the characters before.  

How you solved them:

In the end, I had to search up many tutorials to figure it out. I did this and I had to do trials and errors to make sure it would work. The tutorials wouldn't work sometimes and once the spikes weren't solid, instead the player could walk through. I later figured out that I had put on the wrong type of collider.

What youâ€™re most proud of in your game so far:
I'm most proud of the fact that I have a win condition and lose condition. This makes my game more fun as there is an actual point for the game. Also, I am proud that I was able to figure out how to loop the music properly.
